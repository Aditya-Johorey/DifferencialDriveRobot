# ü§ñ Practical Robotics ‚Äì Autonomous Differential-Drive Robot

This project showcases the design, assembly, and control of a **differential-drive mobile robot** equipped with autonomous navigation, localization, and visual perception capabilities.

This robot combines sensor fusion, motor control, and mapping techniques to explore a grid-based maze and avoid obstacles using SLAM and computer vision.
